Playing around with tiling and xbox controllers this Sunday.

I took toji's tile to texture code:

And kinda ripped into it a bit.  I made it fullscreen (even though its stretch).  
I also put hooked up the gamepad.  To move around, hook up a 360 controller and
press a button, then use the left stick to look around.

I'm also playing around with some very very basic parsing of data produced by Tiled.

This was really simple, and very easy to do.
